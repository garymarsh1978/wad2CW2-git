    <p>We are our an organisation that provides food to pantries who supply many vulnerable and impoverished families with surplus food that otherwise would go to waste.
       This venture is about connecting the many growers of vegetables and fruit to the pantries in Glasgow.  This means that good food is not wasted and fosters kindness and community spirit in Scotland's people!  <br><br>
       If you are a grower with surplus food,  you can register as a user and donate the food at the drop off centre. 
       Once it is deposited there it will be viewable to all the pantries throughout Glasgow which can select the food and distribute it to those who most need it.
    <br> Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated!</p>
